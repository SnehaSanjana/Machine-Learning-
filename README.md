# Machine-Learning-
This repository has all my Mini Projects based on Machine Learning which includes:

1)Restaurent Review:        I am dealing with the Restaurant reviews dataset. In this Dataset,
                            There are two columns namely, Review and Liked. The review column has all the reviews given by the customer. And in Liked column it can be either 0 or 1. 1 indicates positive review and 0 indicates negative review.
                            And built a machine learning model using both Support Vector Classifier(SVC) and Count Vectorizer methods and finally, this model is going to predict whether the given review is either positive or negative.

2)Heart Disease Prediction: These days there are high rates of people getting a heart attack and many other heart related issues. People are dieing due to it not being predicted properly at the early stage,
                            here I have taken the heart disease detection dataset and putting out interesting inferences from the data to derive some meaningful results.
                            Exploratory data analysis(EDA) is the key step for getting meaningful results.
                            The Algorithm that I have used here is Logistic Regression.
  
3)IPL Match Prediction:     To discuss the IPL team win prediction based on some match stats, I am trying to predicting who is the winner of an IPL match through this project, we will get familiar with the exploratory data analysis and feature engineering techniques that need to be applied to process data.
                            The data set used here is the IPL dataset, which contains the details regarding the winner and match stats. It contains the details like teams played, winner, venue of the match, won by how many wickets and runs, toss decision, whether DLS applied or not, names of the umpires etc.
                            Performing exploratory data analysis and data engineering on this data is very important. and 
4)Parkinson Detections:     Parkinson Disease is a brain neurological disorder. It leads to shaking of the body, hands and provides stiffness to the body. No proper cure or treatment is available yet at the advanced stage.
                            Treatment is possible only when done at the early or onset of the disease.
                            Here to get to know if a person has Parkinsonâ€™s disease or not and to detect the early onset of the disease. We will use Support Vector Machines (SVMs)Algorithm and utilize the data-set available

5)Mobile Range Prediction:  This model helps us predict the price range of the mobile phones by doing some calcultaions and i am using Logistic Regression,SVM,KNN and Random Forest.
                            Here the dataset used is mobile_range_prediction.
